# Scope stuff for myself
# COMPLETED
# [x] verify that there is 2 inputs given at command line, if not, specify you need 2 required
# [x] verify first path is valid  (very simple check - other edge cases exist that I'm not obsessing over)
# [x] verify second path is valid (very simple check - other edge cases exist that I'm not obsessing over)
# [x] each path must be specific '/'
# [x] refresher on yaml file structure
# [x] convert csv to yaml
# [x] create functions instead of having everything in the main script
# [x] add __name__ for ideal execution
# [x] convert xlsv to yaml method completion

# WORKING ON / TO DO
# [ ] write unit tests (major issues with pytest - i believe virtual environment related)
# [ ] for ones with data containing nothing, we still need to print the header with blank data
# [ ] enable automated tests with github actions (add pytest to GH actions yaml file)
# [ ] for yaml out path/file, if only filename is given, use pwd
# [ ] check if .yml or .yaml extension is given as output file, if not, append to output.

Good afternoon, Ryan, pleasure speaking with you.  Just to re-iterate, this is compensated homework at $50.
I hope you don't spend more than eight hours on it (excluding bonus points int this time estimate).
The goals are three-fold:

    evaluate your ability to learn new technologies
    see what questions you ask
    verify your ability to work remotely

Meta Requirements:
    [X] Code must be in github, in a private repo
    [ ] Unit tests
    [X] A README explaining how to run/test/verify the code

Actual requirements:
    The script should take two cmd-line parameters:
        - the path to the input CSV file itself
        - the path to the YAML output file

    See attached CSV file.  It's a real, anonymized subset of our real data set in FNMA
    It's a description of some pieces of software, but the specific contents don't really matter for this assignment

    Write a Python script to convert the file to YAML

    Basically, for each software asset (i.e., each row),
        -> the columns should become a field in the YAML
        -> Output YAML should something like (doesn't have to be exact):
            - Asset ID: MSR012312
              Asset Name: QRM-AWS
              Asset Code: FRF
              other fields: ....
            - Asset ID: MSR02341
              Asset Name: Multifamily Negotiated Txs
              other fields

Make sense?

Bonus points for being able to do the same thing with the Excel file (.xlsx) as well as the csv.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
